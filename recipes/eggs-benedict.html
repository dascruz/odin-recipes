    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>3.5 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground white pepper</li>
        <li>0.1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>0.25 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>8 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>8 strips Canadian-style bacon</li>
        <li>4 English muffins, split</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            To Make Hollandaise: Fill the bottom of a double boiler part-way with water. Make
            sure that water does not touch the top pan. Bring water to a gentle simmer. In the top
            of the double boiler, whisk together egg yolks, lemon juice, white pepper,
            Worcestershire sauce, and 1 tablespoon water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the melted butter to egg yolk mixture 1 or 2 tablespoons at a time while whisking
            yolks constantly. If hollandaise begins to get too thick, add a teaspoon or two of hot
            water. Continue whisking until all butter is incorporated. Whisk in salt, then remove
            from heat. Place a lid on pan to keep sauce warm.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat oven on broiler setting. To Poach Eggs: Fill a large saucepan with 3 inches of
            water. Bring water to a gentle simmer, then add vinegar. Carefully break eggs into
            simmering water, and allow to cook for 2.5 to 3 minutes. Yolks should still be soft in
            center. Remove eggs from water with a slotted spoon and set on a warm plate.
        </li>
        <li>
            While eggs are poaching, brown the bacon in a medium skillet over medium-high
            heat and toast the English muffins on a baking sheet under the broiler.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread toasted muffins with softened butter, and top each one with a slice of bacon,
            followed by one poached egg. Place 2 muffins on each plate and drizzle with
            hollandaise sauce. Sprinkle with chopped chives and serve immediately.
